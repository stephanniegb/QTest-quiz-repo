IN THE HOME COMPONET SUBMIT AND RETRIEVE
I tried using useref hook to grab the form and do god knows what so that ill be able submit and still retrieve the data from the form element... that was a bad idea.

At the end I used the usenavigate hook in an on submit function gthis did all i needed before it went ahead and navigated!
